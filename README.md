The challenge is to implement this design and make it responsive to different screen sizes.

## What I did

- I used `width` property set to `fit-content` to avoid the hover effect when hovering next to the text instead of directly over it .

- Like the previous challene, used flexbox to make the layout responsive across different screens.

- Used flexbox to make the footer image and the name on the same horizontal line and centered.
